# Why would anyone need JavaScript generator functions?

---

## You might not need generator functions

---

## Perhaps you don’t need promises

---

<img src="src/assets/carmm-2018.png" alt="" />

---

## You might not care about generator functions

---

1. Efficient code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Impossible code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Safer code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## What is a generator function?

---

```javascript [|1|3-8|11-13|16]
function* myGeneratorFunction() {
    // We create some data
    const claim01 = 'Efficient code';
    console.log('Created some data. Yielding', claim01);
    yield claim01;

    // And another bit of data
    const claim02 = 'Impossible code';
    console.log('Created some data. Yielding', claim02);
    yield claim02;

    // The line below might not do what you think it does.
    return 42;
}
```

---

## What happens if we run this function?

---

```javascript
let generator = myGeneratorFunction();
```

---

## It doesn't do anything

---

## A generator object

---

```javascript
function runGenerator(generator) {
    let result;
    do {
        result = generator.next();
        console.log(result);
    } while (!result.done);
}
```

---

## So what?

---

## Like arrays, but more awkward

---

## Efficient code

---

## The Tim Tam Slam

---

1. Select a single biscuit.
2. Bite a small chunk from one corner, 2&ndash;5&thinsp;mm from the apex.
3. Repeat the bite on the diagonally opposite corner.
4. Insert one of the bitten corners into a hot beverage. (Milo is traditional, but coffee, tea, or hot chocolate is also acceptable).
5. Place your lips over the opposite corner, and draw liquid through the biscuit as if it were a straw.
6. As soon as liquid enters your mouth, immediately consume the entire biscuit. It’s important to do this quickly before it loses its structural integrity.
7. Repeat until there are no more Tim Tams, or you feel physically ill.

---

```javascript
const bittenBiscuit = biteArbitraryCorner(biscuit);
const doubleBitten = biteOppositeCorner(bittenBiscuit);
const biscuitInBeverage = insertIntoBeverage(doubleBitten);
const unstableBiscuit = drawLiquid(biscuitInBeverage);
insertIntoMouth(unstableBiscuit);
```
